### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniil and I'm currently looking for a job.

I'm a frontend engineer with 8+ years of experience and a strong understanding of the modern frontend ecosystem. I also have solid experience with Node.js backends, so I'm comfortable working as fullstack developer. I'm open to learning other BE languages your company uses.

I've been working with React and TypeScript since 2015. I am also highly proficient with MobX, Next.js, Node.js, Prisma and other technologies. I would also be happy to work with Svelte or Flutter.

Please feel free to get in touch with me if you have a suitable opportunity:
