### Hi there 👋

My name is Daniil, and I am currently looking for new job opportunities.

I am a full stack engineer with over 10 years of experience and a strong understanding of the modern web development ecosystem. I prioritize scalability, maintainability, and code consistency while providing [technical clarity](https://www.seangoedecke.com/clarity/) and delivering high quality features.

I've been working with React and TypeScript since 2015. I am also highly proficient in Next.js (and other SSR frameworks like TanStack or SvelteKit), Node.js, MobX (or almost any other state manager), different kinds of ORMs and lots of other technologies. I would be happy to work with other frameworks Flutter or Vue, and I'm always up for learning new languages (Looking at you, Rust).

I am based in Oviedo, a small city in northern Spain, and I am currently only open to remote roles.

If you know of a good job for me, please get in touch:
