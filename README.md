### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniil, and I'm currently seeking new job opportunities.

I'm a frontend engineer with over 9 years of experience and a deep understanding of the modern frontend ecosystem. I also have solid experience with Node.js backends, making me comfortable working as a full-stack developer. I'm open to learning other languages that your company uses.

I've been working with React and TypeScript since 2015. I am also highly proficient with MobX, Next.js, Node.js, Prisma and other technologies. I would also be happy to work with Svelte or Flutter.

I'm based in Valencia, Spain, and I am currently open to remote roles only.

If you have a suitable opportunity, please feel free to reach out:
