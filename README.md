### Hi there 👋

My name is Daniil, and I am currently looking for new job opportunities.

I am a full stack engineer with over 10 years of experience and a strong understanding of the modern web development ecosystem. 

I've been working with React and TypeScript since 2015. I am also highly proficient in Next.js, Node.js, MobX, different kinds of ORMs and lots of other technologies. I'm always up for learning new languages and would be happy to work with other frameworks like Svelte or Flutter.

I'm located in a small city in the north of Spain called Oviedo, and I am currently open to remote roles only.

If you have a suitable opportunity for me, please feel free to reach out:
